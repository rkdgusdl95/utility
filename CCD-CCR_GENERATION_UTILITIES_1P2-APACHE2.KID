CCR Project release v1.2
"BLD",8461,1,16,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,17,0)
The purpose of the CCR package is to provide support for exporting and 
"BLD",8461,1,18,0)
eventually importing patient information from/to VistA in XML documents 
"BLD",8461,1,19,0)
conforming to the Continuity of Care Record (CCR - ASTM) and Continuity 
"BLD",8461,1,20,0)
of Care Document (CCD - HL7) standards.
"BLD",8461,1,21,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,22,0)
This version of the CCR package provides:
"BLD",8461,1,23,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,24,0)
EXPORT^C0CCCR
"BLD",8461,1,25,0)
A command line interface to export a single patient's CCR to a host 
"BLD",8461,1,26,0)
directory by specifying the patient by name.
"BLD",8461,1,27,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,28,0)
EXPORT^C0CCCD
"BLD",8461,1,29,0)
A command line interface to export a single patient's CCD to a host 
"BLD",8461,1,30,0)
directory by specifying the patient by name. As an alternative to 
"BLD",8461,1,31,0)
generating the CCD directly, an XSLT transformation is available to 
"BLD",8461,1,32,0)
translate a CCR into a level 2 CCD. This tranformation has been tested 
"BLD",8461,1,33,0)
and produces a CCD with all currently supported sections of the CCR. The 
"BLD",8461,1,34,0)
EXPORT^C0CCCD only extracts the PROBLEMS section into a CCD.
"BLD",8461,1,35,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,36,0)
XPAT^C0CCCR(DFN,OUTDIR,OUTFILE)
"BLD",8461,1,37,0)
A command line and program interface to export a single patient's CCR 
"BLD",8461,1,38,0)
using the IEN of the patient in the ^DPT file (DFN).
"BLD",8461,1,39,0)
OUTDIR specifies an existing directory on the Host system into which the 
"BLD",8461,1,40,0)
CCR XML document will be written. If OUTDIR is null (""), the output 
"BLD",8461,1,41,0)
directory name will be taken from ^TMP("C0CCCR","ODIR").
"BLD",8461,1,42,0)
OUFILE specifies the host file name of the CCR XML document that will be 
"BLD",8461,1,43,0)
written for this patient. If OUTFILE is null ("") the document name will 
"BLD",8461,1,44,0)
default to PAT_x_CCR_V1.xml where x is the DFN of the patient.
"BLD",8461,1,45,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,46,0)
CCRRPC(CCRGRTN,DFN,CCRPARMS,CCRPART)
"BLD",8461,1,47,0)
An RPC and program interface to return in return array CCRGRTN (passed by 
"BLD",8461,1,48,0)
reference) a single patient's CCR.
"BLD",8461,1,49,0)
DFN is the patient's IEN
"BLD",8461,1,50,0)
CCRPART is what portion of the CCR should be returned. If "CCR" is 
"BLD",8461,1,51,0)
specified, the entire CCR will be returned. If "PROBLEMS", "VITALS", or 
"BLD",8461,1,52,0)
"MEDICATIONS" is specified, only that section of the CCR will be returned.
"BLD",8461,1,53,0)
CCRPARMS ARE PARAMETERS THAT AFFECT THE EXTRACTION
"BLD",8461,1,54,0)
IN THE FORM "PARM1:VALUE1^PARM2:VALUE2"
"BLD",8461,1,55,0)
EXAMPLE: "LABLIMIT:T-60" TO LIMIT LAB EXTRACTION TO THE LAST 60 DAYS
"BLD",8461,1,56,0)
SEE C0CPARMS FOR A COMPLETE LIST OF SUPPORTED PARAMETERS
"BLD",8461,1,57,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,58,0)
ANALYZE^C0CRIMA(BGNDFN,DFNCNT,CCRPARMS)
"BLD",8461,1,59,0)
A command line and program interface to analyze the data from multiple 
"BLD",8461,1,60,0)
patients into categories that can be batch extracted.
"BLD",8461,1,61,0)
BGNDFN is the beginning DFN to be analyzed. If BGNDFN is null ("") its 
"BLD",8461,1,62,0)
value will be taken from ^TMP("C0CRIM","RESUME"). If this variable does 
"BLD",8461,1,63,0)
not exist, the routine will start with the first IEN in the patient file 
"BLD",8461,1,64,0)
^DPT. ^TMP("C0CRIM","RESUME") is updated to the "next" patient to be 
"BLD",8461,1,65,0)
analyzed on successful completion.
"BLD",8461,1,66,0)
DFNCNT is the count of how many patient records will be analyzed in this 
"BLD",8461,1,67,0)
execution.
"BLD",8461,1,68,0)
For example ANALYZE^C0CRIMA(1000,1000) would start at patient DFN 1000 
"BLD",8461,1,69,0)
and analyzes 1000 patient records. ANALYZE^C0CRIMA("",1000) would then 
"BLD",8461,1,70,0)
analyze the next 1000 patients. When the end of the patient file is 
"BLD",8461,1,71,0)
reached, the routine terminates with a message that RESET^C0CRIMA would 
"BLD",8461,1,72,0)
need to be called to restart the analysis.
"BLD",8461,1,73,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,74,0)
The categories into which the records are analyzed consist of attribute 
"BLD",8461,1,75,0)
strings. The attributes represent characteristics of the variables that 
"BLD",8461,1,76,0)
can be extracted for a given patient into the CCR or the CCD. This 
"BLD",8461,1,77,0)
version supports the following attributes:
"BLD",8461,1,78,0)
VITALS : the patient has variables for the VITALS section of the CCR/CCD
"BLD",8461,1,79,0)
PROBLEMS : the patient has variables for the PROBLEMS section of the 
"BLD",8461,1,80,0)
CCR/CCD
"BLD",8461,1,81,0)
MEDS : the patient has variables for the MEDICATIONS section of the 
"BLD",8461,1,82,0)
CCR/CCD
"BLD",8461,1,83,0)
HEADER : the patient has variables for the HEADER section of the CCR/CCD. 
"BLD",8461,1,84,0)
All patients are marked with the HEADER attribute in this version.
"BLD",8461,1,85,0)
NOTEXTRACTED : the CCR or CCD has not yet been produced/extracted for 
"BLD",8461,1,86,0)
this patient. All patient records are marked with the NOTEXTRACTED 
"BLD",8461,1,87,0)
attribute in this version for batch control processing (not implemented 
"BLD",8461,1,88,0)
in this version).
"BLD",8461,1,89,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,90,0)
ANAZYZE^C0CRIMA calls the variable extraction routines that would be used 
"BLD",8461,1,91,0)
to produce a CCR or a CCD and saves the results to ^TMP("C0CRIM",DFN) for 
"BLD",8461,1,92,0)
each patient. In addition, the attribute string for each patient is saved 
"BLD",8461,1,93,0)
in ^TMP("C0CRIM","ATTR")
"BLD",8461,1,94,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,95,0)
Categories are created as they first occur based on each unique 
"BLD",8461,1,96,0)
combination of attributes that is encountered. They are named after the 
"BLD",8461,1,97,0)
attribute table that is used for the analysis. This version supports only 
"BLD",8461,1,98,0)
the attribute table .RIMTBL. and the categories are named "RIMTBL_x". An 
"BLD",8461,1,99,0)
example set of categories from a demo systems is:
"BLD",8461,1,100,0)

A command line interface to show a summary of the categories, record 
"BLD",8461,1,117,0)
counts, and attributes that have been analyzed so far. It produces the 
"BLD",8461,1,118,0)
listing in the example above from information stored in 
"BLD",8461,1,119,0)
^TMP("C0CRIM","CATS","RIMTBL"). It is intended for future versions that

"BLD",8461,1,178,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,179,0)
NOTES:
"BLD",8461,1,180,0)
This version of the package is a prototype, and does not yet make use of 
"BLD",8461,1,181,0)
the standard VistA features that are appropriate for it to use.
"BLD",8461,1,182,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,183,0)
^TMP("C0CCCR","ODIR") must be set manually to the output directory on the 
"BLD",8461,1,184,0)
Host System. It is intended that this be maintainable in a parameter file.
"BLD",8461,1,185,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,186,0)
CCRRPC^C0CCCR and CCDRPC^C0CCCD are intended to be RPC interfaces to the 
"BLD",8461,1,187,0)
package but there is no entry for them in the RPC table and the RPC 
"BLD",8461,1,188,0)
method of access has not been tested.
"BLD",8461,1,189,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,190,0)
Most of the command line interface functions in the package are intended 
"BLD",8461,1,191,0)
to also be made available as RPC calls. This will provide the ability to 
"BLD",8461,1,192,0)
invoke and control batch extraction and analysis via RPCs
"BLD",8461,1,193,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,194,0)
The "RIM" variables and attributes that are now being stored in 
"BLD",8461,1,195,0)
^TMP("C0CRIM") are intended to be maintained in a standard FILEMAN 
"BLD",8461,1,196,0)
global, and to take advantage of FILEMAN indexing for efficient batch 
"BLD",8461,1,197,0)
analysis and processing.
"BLD",8461,1,198,0)
 
"BLD",8461,1,199,0)

"PKG",213,22,1,1,30,0)
directory by specifying the patient by name. As an alternative to 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,31,0)
generating the CCD directly, an XSLT transformation is available to 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,32,0)
translate a CCR into a level 2 CCD. This tranformation has been tested 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,33,0)
and produces a CCD with all currently supported sections of the CCR. The 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,34,0)
EXPORT^C0CCCD only extracts the PROBLEMS section into a CCD.

"PKG",213,22,1,1,38,0)
using the IEN of the patient in the ^DPT file (DFN).
"PKG",213,22,1,1,39,0)
OUTDIR specifies an existing directory on the Host system into which the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,40,0)
CCR XML document will be written. If OUTDIR is null (""), the output 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,41,0)
directory name will be taken from ^TMP("C0CCCR","ODIR").
"PKG",213,22,1,1,42,0)
OUFILE specifies the host file name of the CCR XML document that will be 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,43,0)
written for this patient. If OUTFILE is null ("") the document name will 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,44,0)
default to PAT_x_CCR_V1.xml where x is the DFN of the patient.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,45,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,46,0)
CCRRPC(CCRGRTN,DFN,CCRPARMS,CCRPART)
"PKG",213,22,1,1,47,0)

"PKG",213,22,1,1,48,0)
reference) a single patient's CCR.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,49,0)
DFN is the patient's IEN
"PKG",213,22,1,1,50,0)
CCRPART is what portion of the CCR should be returned. If "CCR" is 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,51,0)
specified, the entire CCR will be returned. If "PROBLEMS", "VITALS", or 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,52,0)
"MEDICATIONS" is specified, only that section of the CCR will be returned.

ANALYZE^C0CRIMA(BGNDFN,DFNCNT,CCRPARMS)
"PKG",213,22,1,1,59,0)
A command line and program interface to analyze the data from multiple 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,60,0)
patients into categories that can be batch extracted.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,61,0)
BGNDFN is the beginning DFN to be analyzed. If BGNDFN is null ("") its 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,62,0)
value will be taken from ^TMP("C0CRIM","RESUME"). If this variable does 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,63,0)
not exist, the routine will start with the first IEN in the patient file 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,64,0)
^DPT. ^TMP("C0CRIM","RESUME") is updated to the "next" patient to be 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,65,0)
analyzed on successful completion.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,66,0)
DFNCNT is the count of how many patient records will be analyzed in this 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,67,0)
execution.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,68,0)
For example ANALYZE^C0CRIMA(1000,1000) would start at patient DFN 1000 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,69,0)
and analyzes 1000 patient records. ANALYZE^C0CRIMA("",1000) would then 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,70,0)
analyze the next 1000 patients. When the end of the patient file is 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,71,0)
reached, the routine terminates with a message that RESET^C0CRIMA would 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,72,0)
need to be called to restart the analysis.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,73,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,74,0)
The categories into which the records are analyzed consist of attribute 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,75,0)
strings. The attributes represent characteristics of the variables that 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,76,0)
can be extracted for a given patient into the CCR or the CCD. This 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,77,0)
version supports the following attributes:
"PKG",213,22,1,1,78,0)
VITALS : the patient has variables for the VITALS section of the CCR/CCD
"PKG",213,22,1,1,79,0)
PROBLEMS : the patient has variables for the PROBLEMS section of the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,80,0)
CCR/CCD
"PKG",213,22,1,1,81,0)
MEDS : the patient has variables for the MEDICATIONS section of the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,82,0)
CCR/CCD
"PKG",213,22,1,1,83,0)
HEADER : the patient has variables for the HEADER section of the CCR/CCD. 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,84,0)
All patients are marked with the HEADER attribute in this version.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,85,0)
NOTEXTRACTED : the CCR or CCD has not yet been produced/extracted for 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,86,0)
this patient. All patient records are marked with the NOTEXTRACTED 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,87,0)
attribute in this version for batch control processing (not implemented 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,88,0)
in this version).
"PKG",213,22,1,1,89,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,90,0)
ANAZYZE^C0CRIMA calls the variable extraction routines that would be used 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,91,0)
to produce a CCR or a CCD and saves the results to ^TMP("C0CRIM",DFN) for 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,92,0)
each patient. In addition, the attribute string for each patient is saved 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,93,0)
in ^TMP("C0CRIM","ATTR")
"PKG",213,22,1,1,94,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,95,0)
Categories are created as they first occur based on each unique 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,96,0)
combination of attributes that is encountered. They are named after the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,97,0)
attribute table that is used for the analysis. This version supports only 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,98,0)
the attribute table .RIMTBL. and the categories are named "RIMTBL_x". An 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,99,0)

NOTES:
"PKG",213,22,1,1,180,0)
This version of the package is a prototype, and does not yet make use of 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,181,0)
the standard VistA features that are appropriate for it to use.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,182,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,183,0)
^TMP("C0CCCR","ODIR") must be set manually to the output directory on the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,184,0)
Host System. It is intended that this be maintainable in a parameter file.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,185,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,186,0)
CCRRPC^C0CCCR and CCDRPC^C0CCCD are intended to be RPC interfaces to the 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,187,0)
package but there is no entry for them in the RPC table and the RPC 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,188,0)
method of access has not been tested.
"PKG",213,22,1,1,189,0)
 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,190,0)
Most of the command line interface functions in the package are intended 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,191,0)
to also be made available as RPC calls. This will provide the ability to 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,192,0)
invoke and control batch extraction and analysis via RPCs
"PKG",213,22,1,1,193,0)

The "RIM" variables and attributes that are now being stored in 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,195,0)
^TMP("C0CRIM") are intended to be maintained in a standard FILEMAN 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,196,0)
global, and to take advantage of FILEMAN indexing for efficient batch 
"PKG",213,22,1,1,197,0)
analysis and processing.

project in April, 2009. It contains a record for every time the batch 
"^DIC",177.301,177.301,"%D",3,0)
process (EN^C0CBAT) is run. The key is the date and time of the run, 
"^DIC",177.301,177.301,"%D",4,0)
established at the beginning of the run. The file supports the creation 
"^DIC",177.301,177.301,"%D",5,0)
of a "hot list" of patients who are more likely to have changes in their 
"^DIC",177.301,177.301,"%D",6,0)
